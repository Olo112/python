# This is how data structures work
# Data structures are mostly used in:
# - Big Data
# - Data analisers
# - Data science
# Im going to be using it for data science
# Lets get into it

# Num. 2 - dictionaries

Dict = {1:1, 2:"2", 3.0:True}
print(Dict)

input("Press enter to finish...")
'''
A dictionary uses Its own way that is usually called key-value.
So in the dictionary way: Dict = { key : value }
a key stores a value like a variable and a value can be any data type,
but the key can be too!
