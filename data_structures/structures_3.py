# This is how data structures work
# Data structures are mostly used in:
# - Big Data
# - Data analisers
# - Data science
# Im going to be using it for data science
# Lets get into it

# Num. 3 - sets()

Set = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
print(Set)

Set_2 = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}
print(Set_2)
# To the output:
# I can even write thousands of numbers, but in the output it will be printed only once

array = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
print(array)
